        <h2>Distribution</h2>
        <p>Toucans are native to the Neotropics, from Southern Mexico, through Central America, into South America south to northern Argentina. They mostly live in the lowland tropics, but the montane species from the genus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andigena">Andigena</a> reach temperate climates at high altitudes in the Andes and can be found up to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_line">tree line</a>.</p>

        <h2>Behaviour</h2>
        <p>Toucans are highly social and most species occur in groups of up to 20 or more birds for most of the time. Pairs may retire from the groups during the breeding season, then return with their offspring after the breeding season. Larger groups may form during irruptions, migration or around a particularly large fruiting tree.</p>

        <p>Toucans often spend time sparring with their bills, tag-chasing and calling, during the long time it takes for fruit to digest. These behaviours may be related to maintenance of the pair bond or establishing dominance hierarchies, but the digestion time of fruit, which can take up to 75 minutes during which the toucan can't feed, provide this social time.</p>
